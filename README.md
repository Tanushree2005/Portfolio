#About me
Hi,I'm Tanushree Mandavilli,a passionate second-year IT student at PICT(Pune Institue of Computer Technology).I achieved a CGPA of 9.91 in the second semester of my first year, reflecting my dedication and enthusiasm for my studies.I secured an all-over Maharashtra rank of 656 in the girls' category in the CET (Common Entrance Test), which helped me gain admission to PICT.
My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for how digital systems work, and it has since evolved into a deep commitment to solving complex problems and building innovative solutions.I am expanding my knowledge and skills by learning new technologies.I’m proficient in C++, Java, and Python, which have helped me build a strong foundation in software engineering principles. On the front-end side, I have hands-on experience with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. These skills allow me to design and develop dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing web interfaces. I’m diving into back-end development with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and I’m aiming to learn React to complete my full-stack skill set.My goal is to become a proficient MERN developer, capable of building comprehensive and scalable web applications.
